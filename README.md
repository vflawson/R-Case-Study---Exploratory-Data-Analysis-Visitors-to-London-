# R-Case-Study---Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Visitors-to-London-
Case study of exploratory data analysis on international visitors to London (2002 to 2020) using R

Understanding distributions and behaviors of international visitors to the city of London from 2002 to 2020.

Open data from the City of London Datastore: https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/number-international-visitors-london

As 2020 data was mislabeled due to dataset being in the middle of 2020, I needed to replace missing year values with "2020".

For my purposes, as the dataset provided sample sizes of the measurements of visitors to London, I excluded any values with a
sample size of 1 from consideration. 

Tables and graphs are explored in the code, understanding such phenomena as the top countries by average stay, spend per night,
total stay length. I also explored distributions of spend by mode of transportation entering the country and purpose of visit.

These findings can have poignant business applications for city planning, commercial development, and tourism promotion.
